In addition to clicking, it would be great to set the excitement level by pressing a number on the keyboard. To do that, we'll need to use a subscription! 

Elm can let us know when a key is pressed if we use the [elm-lang/keyboard package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/keyboard/latest), so let's install it.

```
elm package install elm-lang/keyboard
```
