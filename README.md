# EDoCElmDemo
Elm Demo for Erie Day of Code 2017

All right, let's get started with Elm!

Elm compiles to javascript, so it's an ideal language for building components
for the web. If we want to see anything that we're building, we'll want to be able to display it in the browser!

The first thing we need to do is install the [elm-lang/html package](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/latest).

```bash
elm package install elm-lang/html
```

This will also install [elm-lang/core](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest) for us. Look at all of those goodies!
