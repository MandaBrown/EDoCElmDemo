now for update (map from the slides)

takes a message and a model and returns a model

let's add some excitement

``` elm
update : EdocMsg -> EdocModel -> EdocModel
update msg model =
    let
        newTitle =
            model ++ "!"
    in
        newTitle

```

... great, compiles, but doesn't do anything
