Now we want to build to elm js

It's no fun to manually build and refresh every time - let's start up a server with elm live:

```bash
elm live Main.elm --output=elm.js
```

make text a h1

```elm
    h1 [] [ text "Hello, World!" ]
```

add a cow 

```elm
    h1 [] [ text "Hello, World! 🐮" ]
```

add elm.js to .gitignore
