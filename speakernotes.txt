now let's fill out update

1st, there is a type alias, Msg. Let's rename that because it often gets confused with msg

> The Msg type describes these capabilities as data. Important! 

What actions are we going to have?

Let's do something when we click on the title, silly but works (TitleClicked)

dont forget to change the view signature!!!

note the "msg" at the top
stand-in for type, Html doesn't know what types we're going to give it

```elm
type Answer a = Yes | No | Other a
```
