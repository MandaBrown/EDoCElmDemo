The argument to function `downs` is causing a mismatch.

57|     Keyboard.downs KeyPressed
                       ^^^^^^^^^^
Function `downs` is expecting the argument to be:

    Keyboard.KeyCode -> EdocMsg

But it is:

    EdocMsg

Hint: It looks like a function needs 1 more argument.



remember we get a constructor with types?

KeyPressed : EdocMsg

and we can pass data along

if we make our constructor:

KeyPressed : Keyboard.Keycode -> EdocMsg

then we have the method that keyboard downs wants!
