what about cmds?

A command is a way of telling Elm, “Hey, I want you to do this thing!” So if you want to send an HTTP request, you would need to command Elm to do it. Or if you wanted to ask for geolocation, you would need to command Elm to go get it.

Should we try an http request?

install http

```bash
elm package install elm-lang/http
```

add a command!
(and a decoder, ignore that for now)

```
getCowGif : Cmd EdocMsg
getCowGif =
    let
        url =
            "https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&tag=happy+cow&rating=g"

        request =
            Http.get url decodeGifUrl
    in
        Http.send NewGif request


decodeGifUrl : Decode.Decoder String
decodeGifUrl =
    Decode.at [ "data", "image_url" ] Decode.string

```
