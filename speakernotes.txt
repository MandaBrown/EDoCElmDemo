```
The `main` value has an unsupported type.
I need Html, Svg, or a Program so I have something to render on screen, but you
gave me:
```

```elm
import Html exposing (Html, div, text)
```

<OPT><UP> for type panel, copy from there:

```elm
div [] [ text "Hello, World!" ]
```

<CMD><SHIFT><B>

missing type annotation is left
