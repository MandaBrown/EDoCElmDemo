let's start with model and make it a string.

we'll also rename it, because i've noticed that a thing that can be confusing to people new to elm is that this name doesn't mean anything or have to be anything in particular. 

it is the Html.beginnerProgram that ties everything together - this is just a piece and we can name it whatever we want.
